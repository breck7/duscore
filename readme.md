DuScore helps you quickly access the quality and usability of a dataset.

High quality, easy to use datasets have lower DuScores. A perfect dataset would have a DuScore of 0.

Datasets accumulate points for having flaws.

DuScore is a list of what the flaws are, and a set of arbitraray weights that the community can decide upon to penalize datasets more for common mistakes.
